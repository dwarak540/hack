   # Intelligent Answer Script Evaluation System 
Description: Design and Develop an Intelligent Answer Script Evaluation 
System for a college to streamline the process of online examination 
assessment. The system will evaluate student responses based on several key 
factors, including the accuracy of answers, plagiarism detection (ensuring less 
than 30% similarity), and the quality of English used in the responses. The 
platform should incorporate a rich user interface (UI) for seamless submission 
of answers and should be equipped with a text corpus to compare answer 
quality. Additionally, the system must utilize Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) techniques to assess the grammar, coherence, and relevance of student 
responses. The challenge involves designing a system that not only provides 
quick, automated grading but also ensures fairness and rigor in evaluating 
answers. The solution should aim to reduce manual efforts while maintaining 
high standards in examination integrity and assessment.
